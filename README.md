# Store Site
A store site developed using NodeJS, JavaScript, HTML & CSS. Includues admin and regular accounts. Regular accounts can browse and search for products, they can also add them to their shopping carts. Regular accounts can also use discount codes in the shopping cart.

Admin accounts can add items to the store with pictures, size/color options, and a description; they can also remove items from the store. Admin accounts can also add new discount codes.

This site was mainly developed by me Abbas Al-Amin, but some of the code is from one of my University teachers which can be seen in the commit history.
